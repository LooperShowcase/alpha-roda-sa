      Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크; RR: Beullaekpingkeu, commonly stylized as
      BLACKPINK or BLɅϽKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG
      Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The
      group debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which
      featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their first number-one entries on
      South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the US Billboard World Digital Song
      Sales chart, respectively. Blackpink is the most successful Korean girl
      group internationally and have often been dubbed the "biggest girl group
      in the world."[1] They are the highest-charting female Korean act on the
      Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with "Ice Cream" (2020), and on
      the Billboard 200, peaking at number one with Born Pink (2022), which is
      the best-selling album of all time by a Korean girl group and the first to
      sell more than two million copies.[2] They were the first girl group to
      top Billboard's Artist 100 and the first Korean girl group to enter and
      top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.[3] Blackpink was also the first
      female Korean act to receive a certification from the Recording Industry
      Association of America (RIAA) with their single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018),
      whose music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one billion
      views and is currently the most-viewed by a Korean group on YouTube.[4]
      Their 2018 song "Kiss and Make Up", a collaboration with Dua Lipa, was the
      first by a Korean group to receive a certification from the British
      Phonographic Industry (BPI)[5] and a platinum certification from the
      Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).[6] The group's debut
      studio album, The Album, (2020) was the first album by a Korean girl group
      to sell more than one million copies and was the highest-charting female
      Korean album on the Billboard 200 at number two, both records that were
      surpassed by their follow-up album Born Pink (2022).[7] Born Pink was the
      first album by a K-pop girl group in history to reach number-one on the
      Billboard 200 as well as the UK Albums Chart.[8] The album's lead single
      "Pink Venom" (2022) was also the first song by a Korean group to top the
      ARIA Singles Chart and the first song by a female Korean act to top the
      Billboard Global 200.[9]
